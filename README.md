A small collection of utility functions for personal use.

## Installation

I have no intention of keeping the package in sort of stable state. The recommended way to use it in a project is to pin it to a specific commit with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv). With that in mind, you can install asmisc from [GitHub](https://github.com/svraka/asmisc) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("svraka/asmisc")
```

Or:

``` r
renv::install("github::svraka/asmisc")
```
